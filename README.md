I recently completed a laptop price prediction project in Python, where I applied various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project involved cleaning and exploring a laptop dataset to understand the factors influencing prices. I then used a combination of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models in a Voting Regressor ensemble to predict laptop prices.

After splitting the data into training and testing sets and scaling the features, the ensemble model achieved an impressive 89.5% accuracy on the test set. This indicates that the model can effectively predict laptop prices based on features like brand, specifications, and performance metrics.

Through this project, I honed my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model building. It also showcased my ability to use Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience and demonstrated my proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques.
